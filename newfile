This is me trying to learn github. That's all. 
I am writing this to see if I am updating the branch only. What have i just learned?
You make a new branch with the command : git branch nameOfBranch
go into it automatically by using git -b branch nameOfBranch
you can check what branch you are on with git status or git branch -a 
you can change into to a different branch with the command : git checkout otherBranchName



The branch is a copy of what is in main that you can alter without messing with the main. 
next I'll see how to merge them. 

//////////////////

The above has now been merged by switching to the main branch and the command: git merge branchName
and git push

now I'm back in the newBranch seeing if this is seperate again.

cool, that worked. now im investigating the different commits.
